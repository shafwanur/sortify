# Note from Shaf in year 2025

I started this project back when I was in 9th/10th grade and just learned to code in Python, so around 2018/2019 I think? I didn't even know what git was back then haha, and I uploaded the code to github much later. It was the first time I did anything with APIs ever, and learned what they were for the first time. 

I'm keeping this repo to hold on to the old code, unfiltered, as I wrote it back then. It was just a simple cli tool back then. I think it's cute, and its interesting to see what solution I found for the problem, in an age before ChatGPT, and as a very young programmer. So this branch just serves a nostalgic purpose for me. 

For the main code, look at the master branch :)
