# spotify-track-sorter

Automates the process of sorting Your Music on Spotify by genre. 

To see what it does, you can checkout [My Spotify Account](https://open.spotify.com/user/31ucvye6x6y7dojbxrokbxf25pwy?si=3WTgc_vlTxu-rBBD06fLjA)'s Public Playlists. If a playlist has a title that resembles some genre, it was created by this script.

I wrote this script with the incentive of easing the process of organising my music directly from a terminal.
